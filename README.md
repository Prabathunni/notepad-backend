# Notepad Backend with File System

##  Project Description

This is a simple backend project built using **Node.js** and **Express** that functions like a basic notepad. The main objective of this project was to understand how backend services work and how to manage data using the **file system module (`fs`)** in Node.js instead of a database.

Users can:
- Add tasks
- Add paragraphs or notes
- Retrieve and view stored data
- Rename file name

All data is stored locally using the Node.js file system, making this project lightweight and database-free.

##  Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- File System (`fs`) module

##  What I Learned

- Creating a backend server using Express
- Handling HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`)
- Using `fs` module to read, rename and write data to files
- Structuring routes and organizing backend logic
- Working with JSON data and request bodies
- Understanding the basics of RESTful API design

This project helped me solidify my foundational understanding of backend development and file-based storage in Node.js.
