# Notepad Backend with File System

##  Project Description

This is a simple backend project built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **EJS** that functions like a basic notepad app. The goal was to understand how backend services work, how to store and retrieve data using the **file system (`fs`)** module, and how to render dynamic content using **EJS templates**.

Users can:
- Add tasks
- Add paragraphs or notes
- Retrieve and view stored data
- Rename file name
- View added content in a clean UI rendered using EJS

All data is stored locally using the Node.js file system, making this project lightweight and database-free.

##  Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates)
- File System (`fs`) module

##  What I Learned

- Creating a backend server using Express
- Handling HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`)
- Using `fs` module to read, rename and write data to files
- Creating and using EJS templates for dynamic HTML rendering
- Structuring routes and organizing backend logic
- Working with JSON data and request bodies
- Understanding the basics of RESTful API design

This project gave me a practical understanding of how backend services interact with templating engines and local file storage, forming a complete dynamic web app without a database.
